# The Plasma Code of Conduct

The canonical version of this document can be found
[in the master branch of the plasma repository](https://github.com/PlasmaLang/plasma/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

We are committed to providing a friendly and safe environment for all,
regardless of level of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual
orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity,
age, religion, nationality, relationship status or other similar
characteristic.

## Contact

If you have any questions or wish to report harassment
you may contact the Plasma community moderators by e-mailing
[mods@plasmalang.org](mailto:mods@plasmalang.org).
This e-mail alias currently
messages Paul Bone only.  Reports will be handled discreetly.

## Rules for conduct

All participants are expected to follow these rules at all times.

* Avoid using rude, sexual, or otherwise inappropriate nicknames or avatars.
* Harassment is unwelcome behaviour, we will exclude anyone engaging in
  harassment.  Harassment may include:
  * Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against
    another person.
  * Discriminatory, hateful, or exclusionary jokes, language, remarks and
    behaviour.
  * Personal insults and cursing directed at another person,
    cursing at things is okay, but not with oppressive language.
  * Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
  * Posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying
    information ("doxing").
  * Inappropriate photography or recording.
  * Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone’s consent before
    touching them.
  * Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or jokes;
    inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances.
  * Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).
  * Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour.
* Disruptive behaviour interferes with other people's ability to contribute
  or use Plasma.
  * Trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing
    behaviour is not welcome.
  * Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and
    presentations.
* The moderators are responsible for maintaining a healthy and happy
  community, and this code of conduct may be subject to change or
  interpretation to achieve that.

## Scope

* These rules apply to the IRC channel, github and the mailing lists and any
  other 'official' place as listed on http://plasmalang.org/contact.html
* Private harassment is also unacceptable.  Whether you're a regular
  contributor or a newcomer, if you feel you have been or are being harassed
  or made uncomfortable by a community member, please contact us (see
  above).  We care about making this community a safe place for you and
  we've got your back.
* Conduct outside the project may affect a person's eligibility to hold a
  position of responsibility (eg: code review, moderation), and may
  contribute to their standing within the Plasma community.

## Good ideas for productive conduct

When differences of opinion arise we want to have productive discussions,
here are some ideas for ensuring discussions remain productive and
respectful.

* Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or
  implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs.
  Disagreements about such decisions are okay so long as they are productive
  and everyone avoids personal attacks.
* Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid ideas
  you want to experiment with, make a fork and see how it works.
* When providing feedback, ask yourself "Is this code/docs/etc better than
  before?" not "Is this contribution perfect?", particularly for new
  contributors.
* Spamming mailing lists, IRC channels etc can make it difficult for
  other on-topic discussions to occur.  Interruptions like these will be
  moderated if necessary.  We do not forbid small off-topic discussions like
  "How was your weekend?" as they are usually positive for the community.

## Moderation

These are the policies for upholding our community's standards of conduct.
If you feel that a discussion needs moderation, please contact the
Moderation Team (see above).

1. Moderators will first respond with a warning for most violations.  If the
   violation is particularly severe mods may exclude someone immediately and
   permanently.
2. If the warning is unheeded, the user will be "kicked," i.e., kicked out
   of the communication channel to cool off.
3. If the user comes back and continues to make trouble, they will be
   banned, i.e., indefinitely excluded.
4. Moderators may choose at their discretion to un-ban the user if it was a
   first offense and they offer the offended party a genuine apology.
5. If a moderator bans someone and you think it was unjustified, please take
   it up with that moderator, or with a different moderator, **in private**.
   Complaints about bans in-channel are not allowed.

* Moderators are held to a higher standard than other community members. If
  a moderator creates an inappropriate situation, they should expect less
  leeway than others.

In the Plasma community we strive to go the extra step to look out for each
other. Don't just aim to be technically unimpeachable, try to be your best
self. In particular, avoid flirting with offensive or sensitive issues,
particularly if they're off-topic; this all too often leads to unnecessary
fights, hurt feelings, and damaged trust; worse, it can drive people away
from the community entirely.

And if someone takes issue with something you said or did, resist the urge
to be defensive. Just stop doing what it was they complained about and
apologize. Even if you feel you were misinterpreted or unfairly accused,
chances are good there was something you could've communicated better —
remember that it's your responsibility to make your fellow contributors
comfortable. Everyone wants to get along and we are all here first and
foremost because we want to talk about cool technology. You will find that
people will be eager to assume good intent and forgive as long as you earn
their trust.

## Other projects

For other projects adopting the Plasma Code of Conduct, please contact the
maintainers of those projects for enforcement. If you wish to use this code
of conduct for your own project, consider explicitly mentioning your
moderation policy or making a copy with your own moderation policy so as to
avoid confusion.
