# Plasma plugin for vim

This plugin for the Vim text editor adds syntax highlighting for the
[Plasma programming language](https://plasmalang.org).
As far as I know it can be installed with a plug-in manager, I'm using
[pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen).

This is my first semi-serious attempt at writing a vim plugin.  If you'd
like to improve it please send patches!

Note that this takes over the .p file extension, so if you also work with
Pascal you may wish to remove this plugin or send a patch.

Install pathogen (or another bundler) and I guess you can do:

    cd .vim/bundle/
    git clone https://github.com/PlasmaLang/vim.git plasma
